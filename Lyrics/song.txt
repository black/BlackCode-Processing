All I hear is the rhythm of my speeding heart
It's getting loud and I can't hide it
Boy, you know the distance is just killing me
Even when I lied right beside ya
And I gotta let my body loose
Never really cared for rules
I gotta get it closer to you
I gotta get to where you are
Rip my shirt and let it fall
Baby, I just feel like wearing
Nothing at all
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing
Nothing at all
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing
Yeah, I'm getting warmer as you're holding me
But I still feel too far away now
Help me please 'cause I can't deal with clothes between us
I just wanna tear 'em off baby
And I gotta let my body loose
Never really cared for rules
I gotta get it closer to you
I gotta get to where you are
Rip my shirt and let it fall
Baby, I just feel like wearing
Nothing at all
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing
Nothing at all
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing
Baby let's tie us tighter together
Yeah, we can tear down this wall
We got to get tighter and tighter together
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing
Oh!
I gotta let my body loose
Baby I just feel like wearing
Nothing at, nothing at
Nothing at all
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing
Nothing at all
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing
Baby let's tie us tighter together
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing
We got to get tighter, tighter together
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing
