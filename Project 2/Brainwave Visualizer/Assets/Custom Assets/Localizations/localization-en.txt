Each of the eight axes in this circular chart correspond to a different frequency band. As your brainwaves naturally fluctuate, the circle will change and flow artistically. By using the left and right arrow on your keyboard, you can change the rendering effect. In the default mode, the color of the radiating pattern is determined by the frequency band at the highest value in that moment in time.",

Try blinking a few times and see how much fainter your brainwave is compared to the electrical impulses generated by your eyelid muscle. Most people study brainwaves by breaking down the signal into its frequency components. The changing bar graph is a display of your brainwaves separated into the frequency bands: Theta, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma. Observe how your brainwave display changes as you listen to different music or do different things.\n\nDisclaimer: The Brainwave Visualizer does some additional dynamic scaling of the EEG and voltage levels to improve its aesthetic behavior, so the ranges shown in these graphs does not accurately represent the full dynamic range of the data.",
