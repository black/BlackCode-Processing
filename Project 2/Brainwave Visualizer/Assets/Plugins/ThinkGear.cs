/**
 * The ThinkGear Connection API is a set of library functions which allow 
 * applications to communicate with ThinkGear modules.  The ThinkGear Connection
 * functions are implemented in a DLL library.  
 * <p>
 * This ThinkGear class for C# is simply a thin interface layer which uses 
 * InteropServices to provide access to the API functions in the ThinkGear 
 * Connection DLL library, allowing C# programs to use the DLL to communicate
 * with ThinkGear modules.
 * <p>
 * Because the class is merely a thin interface to the underlying DLL, it is
 * entirely dependent on the underlying DLL to function, and is therefore only 
 * supported on platforms which can run the DLL (i.e. Windows-compatible platforms).
 * <p>
 * Programs that wish to read data from a ThinkGear module must use, at a minimum,
 * the following function/method calls:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #TG_GetNewConnectionId()}
 * <li>{@link #TG_Connect(int, String, int, int)}
 * <li>{@link #TG_ReadPackets(int, int)}
 * <li>{@link #TG_GetValue(int, int)}
 * <li>{@link #TG_FreeConnection(int)}
 * </ol>
 *
