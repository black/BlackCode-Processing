R2D2 Processing Pitch

A human voice pitch detector in Processing based on Minim audio library.

It currently implements Autocorrelation (AMDF, which works surprisingly well) and Harmonic Product Spectrum (which doesn't work quite well yet).

PitchProject.pde - main sketch file. 
AudioSource.pde - gets audio from wav files or microphones
ToneGenerator.pde - creates an output tone with a triangle wave
PitchDetectorAutocorrelation.pde - an audio listener that uses Autocorrelation to extract pitch from captured sound
PitchDetectorHPS - an audio listaner that uses Harmonic Product Spectrum to extract pitch from captured sound (not working yet)
PitchDetectorFFT - Uses Fast Fourier Transform to naively find the bin with the highest amplitude. Works nicely with monophonic sounds (i.e. whistling)
