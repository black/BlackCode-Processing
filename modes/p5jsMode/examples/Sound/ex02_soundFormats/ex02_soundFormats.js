/**
 *  @name soundFormats
 *  @description <p>Technically, due to patent issues, there is no single
 *  sound format that is supported by all web browsers. While
 *  <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=mp3">mp3 is supported</a> across the
 *  latest versions of major browsers on OS X and Windows, for example,
 *  it may not be available on some less mainstream operating systems and
 *  browsers.</p>
 *
 *  <p>To ensure full compatibility, you can include the same sound file
 *  in multiple formats, e.g. 'sound.mp3' and 'sound.ogg'. (Ogg is an
 *  open source alternative to mp3.) You can convert audio files
 *  into web friendly formats for free online at <a href="
 *  http://media.io/">media.io</a></p>.
 *
 *  <p>The soundFormats() method tells loadSound which formats
 *  we have included with our sketch. Then, loadSound will
 *  attempt to load the first format that is supported by the
 *  client's web browser.</p>
 *
 * <p><em><span class="small"> To run this example locally, you will need the
 * <a href="http://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound">p5.sound library</a>
 * a sound file, and a running <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server">local server</a>.</span></em></p>
