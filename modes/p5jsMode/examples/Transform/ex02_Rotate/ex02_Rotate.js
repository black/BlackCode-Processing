/*
 * @name Rotate
 * @description Rotating a square around the Z axis.
 * To get the results you expect, send the rotate function angle
 * parameters that are values between 0 and PI*2 (TWO_PI which is
 * roughly 6.28). If you prefer to think about angles as degrees
 * (0-360), you can use the radians() method to convert your values.
 * For example: scale(radians(90)) is identical to the statement
 * scale(PI/2). In this example, every even numbered second a jitter
 * is added to the rotation. During odd seconds rotation moves CW and
 * CCW at the speed determined by the last jitter value.
