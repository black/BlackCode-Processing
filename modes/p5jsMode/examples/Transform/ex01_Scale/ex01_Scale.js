/*
 * @name Scale
 * @description Paramenters for the scale() function are values
 * specified as decimal percentages. For example, the method
 * call scale(2.0) will increase the dimension of the shape by
 * 200 percent. Objects always scale from the origin. This example
 * shows how transforms accumulate and also how scale and translate
 * interact depending on their order.
