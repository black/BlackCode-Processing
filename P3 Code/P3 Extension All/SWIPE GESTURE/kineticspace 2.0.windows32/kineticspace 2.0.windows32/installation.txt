To install the software you need the following tools installed on your system:

Troubleshouting:

If no Kinect is found on a Windows machine
   + make sure you have one and it is plugged in
   + because Microsoft has started pushing their own Kinect drivers through Windows update
     it might be necessary to change to non-Microsoft drivers (OpenNI) by follow these step:
     open the device manager, right-click on "Microsoft Kinect\Microsoft Kinect Camera", update
	 driver, "browse my computer...", "Let me pick..." and choose the one which doesn't start 
	 with Microsoft.
   + on some 64 bit systems, a 32 bit driver might be installed, thus try the 32 bit version 
     instead of the 64 bit version
