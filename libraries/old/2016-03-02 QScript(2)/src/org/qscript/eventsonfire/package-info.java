/**
 * <h1>events-on-fire</h1>
 * <p>
 * events-on-fire is an asynchronous eventing mechanism for Java with weak references.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The repeated implementation of the listener pattern for Java is a boring task which cannot be easily abstracted.
 * Events-On-Fire is a way to get rid of this. Events-On-Fire offers a simple mechanism to fire events across your
 * application without the need for any configuration and without the danger of memory leaks.
