/**
 * Allows TABBING between text controls.
 * A tab manager allows the user to use the TAB key to move from one text control
 * (GTextField or GTextArea) to the another. This is useful when creating a 'form'
 * made from several text controls. <br>
 * The tab order is decided by the order the text controls are added to the tab 
 * manager. The TAB key move the focus forwards and SHIFT+TAB moves it backwards.
 * Note that tabbing is not cyclic so pressing TAB on the last control does not
 * set the focus on the first control, in fact it will be ignored. Similar
 * logic applies to SHIFT_TAB on the first control<br>
 * At least 2 controls must be added to the tab manager.
