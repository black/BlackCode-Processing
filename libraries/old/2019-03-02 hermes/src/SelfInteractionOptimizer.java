/**
 * This <code>Optimizer</code> reduces the time needed to handle interactions between all members of 
 * 	the same group, and also eliminates duplicate interactions. Each member will be checked
 * 	against each other member of the group exactly once. This works only if the interactions
 * 	are commutative, ie handle(A,B) is equivalent to handle(B,A).
 * <br>
 * Detection under this optimizer is still an O(n^2) operation, but using it will reduce
 * 	total calculation time by a factor of approximately 1/2 (the number of computations
 * 	performed will be n(n-1) / 2, where n is the number of beings in the group).
