/*

 This is a generative Shoot-Em-UP or "Bullet Hell" system. 
 You have a character on the left (the "Subject") that can move and shoot. 
 You can generate enemies ("Others") that travel from left to right
 The system is controlled entirely with OSC, so it is ripe for exploration via strange data sets (oscillators, clocks, other games, etc).
 
 This code is rough around the edges - a more (computationally) efficient design might involve creating pools of Beings (Subjects/Others/Shots) up front.
 Such a design might be better for a program like this, where one sometimes finds oneself spawning hundreds of objects per second.....
 Also this design is 90% OO encapsulation 10% Processing wonky globals, forgive my sins. 
 
 =======================================
 Inputs:
 =======================================
 
 To control this game/system, the user will send messages to the following OSC addresses: 
 
 	/SetSubjectX
 	/SetSubjectY
 		move the Subject on an x and y axis (continuous value between 0.0 and 1.0)
 	/SetOtherSpawnX
 	/SetOtherSpawnY
 		specify the x and y coordinate of where new Others are generated
 	/SetOtherSpeed
 		set how fast Others travel 
 	/MakeSubjectShoot
 		shoot a bullet from the player ship (trigger value of 1.0)
 	/GenerateOther
 		generate enemy ships (trigger value of 1.0)
 
 
 **NOT currently in place, but potential future additons maybe?
 	-/ChangeOtherStyle
 		ability to step through a set of graphics, determining how new Others will be drawn (trigger value of 1.0)
 	-/ChangeBackgroundStyle
 		ability to step through a minimal set of background graphics / colors (trigger value of 1.0)
 **
 
 =======================================
 Outputs:
 =======================================
 
 To use this game to control other systems, one should monitor these addresses:
 
 	/OldestOtherX
 	/OldestOtherY
 		oldest Other's x and y 
 	/NewestOtherX
 	/NewestOtherY
 		newest Other's x and y
 	/MainCollidedWithOther
 		notification of player ship collision (trigger value of 1.0)
 	/OtherDestroyed
 		notification of destruction of an enemy ship (trigger value of 1.0)
 /OtherDestroyedAtY
 /OtherDestroyedAtX
 x and y of the last destroyed Other
