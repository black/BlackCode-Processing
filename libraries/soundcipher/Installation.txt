SoundCipher Installation

1. Copy the "soundcipher" folder to Processing's libraries directory. For OSX this will require selecting "Show Package Contents" by right-clicking on the application.2. If you want the examples to appear in Processing's file/examples/libraries menu then create a SoundCipher folder in Processing's examples/Libraries directory and copy the "soundcipher (music)" folder into it.3. Restart Processing.

Enjoy.
