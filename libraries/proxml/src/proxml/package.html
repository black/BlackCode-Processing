The proXML library allows Processing to read and write XML files. You can build 
a XML document by putting together different elements, or you can load an XML element 
from a certain url. When you have the XML-element filled with content you can save it
as file on your harddisk.
</p>
<p>
The Extensible Markup Language XML has become the standard for exchanging structured data 
in Internet applications. proXML allows you to easily integrate and manipulate this data 
in Processing. 
</p>
<p>
Like HTML, XML uses tags to specify, or mark up, a body of text, but instead of using predefined 
tags to indicate how text should appear in a web browser, you define tags that represent the 
type of a piece of data. XML separates the structure of the information from the way it appears, 
so the same XML document can be used and reused in different environments.
</p>
<p>
Every XML tag represents a node also called element. A node can be a XML element a text node.
If it is a XML element it can have attributes. An element nested in another element is called 
the child of this element. Every element can have several child elements this results in a 
hierarchical tree structure of elements, that is called the XML DOM. 
</p>
<p>
The following example is a xml file representing several ellipses.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;ellipses&gt;
  &lt;ellipse&gt;
    &lt;position yPos="152" xPos="127"/&gt;
    &lt;size Xsize="61" Ysize="54"/&gt;
  &lt;/ellipse&gt;
  &lt;ellipse&gt;
    &lt;position yPos="155" xPos="212"/&gt;
    &lt;size Xsize="33" Ysize="66"/&gt;
  &lt;/ellipse&gt;
  &lt;ellipse&gt;
    &lt;position yPos="246" xPos="130"/&gt;
    &lt;size Xsize="65" Ysize="48"/&gt;
  &lt;/ellipse&gt;
&lt;/ellipses&gt;
</pre>
<p>
&lt;ellipses&gt; is the root node; it has no attributes and contains the child nodes &lt;ellipse&gt;, 
which has two child elements &lt;position&gt; and &lt;size&gt; &lt;position&gt; has two attributes
yPos and xPos.
