 * BiquadCustomCoeffCalculator provides a mechanism to define custom filter
 * coefficients for a {@link BiquadFilter} based on frequency and Q. Users can
 * create their own coefficient calculator classes by extending this class and
 * passing it to a BiquadFilter instance with {@link BiquadFilter#setType(int)}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * An instance of such a custom class should override
 * {@link #calcCoeffs(float, float, float)} to define the coefficient
 * calculation algorithm. The floats a0, a1, a2, b0, b1, and b2 should be set
 * according to the input parameters freq, q, and gain, as well as the useful
 * class variables {@link #sampFreq} and {@link #two_pi_over_sf}.
