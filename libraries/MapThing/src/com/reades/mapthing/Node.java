/**
 * <p>A simple node class that holds references to a
 * position and an identifier. You would <i>usually</i>
 * want to extend this class to do something more
 * clever, but this is also used internally to hold
 * the transformed coordinates within a Polygons/Lines/Points object.</p>
 *  
 * <p>The idea here is that we take our complex
 * geographic coordinates from the data source and turn
 * them into simple objects that are easy to draw in 
 * Processing as this will be faster and it will also
 * be simpler to move them around and do things like 
 * zoom and pan.</p>
