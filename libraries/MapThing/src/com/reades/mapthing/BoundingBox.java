	 * faffing about on your own. For now, however, you

	 * assume a system that maps pretty cleanly on to x and
	 * y coordinates.
	 * 
	 * So consider this method a fairly useless extension
	 * *for the time being* since we only store and don't 
	 * really do much with the projection string.
	 * But if you want to specify a particular projection then
	 * you will need to tell us what one you're using in 
	 * the standard EPSG/OGC WKT form (go to http://spatialreference.org/
	 * and then pick 'OGC WKT' as the format and look for the *last*
	 * 'AUTHORITY' declaration in the PROJCS command).
	 * The default (if you don't specify a reference) is

	 * made it easy to use OSGB coordinates too. For everything
