/*
This sketch shows how to use envelopes and oscillators. Envelopes are pre-defined amplitude 
distribution over time. The sound library provides an ASR envelope which stands for attack, 
sustain, release. The amplitude rises then sustains at the maximum level and decays slowly 
depending on pre defined time segments.
