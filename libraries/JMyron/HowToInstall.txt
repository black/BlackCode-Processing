*** INSTALLING JMYRON ***


Copy the "JMyron" folder found in this directory into the Processing/libraries directory.

Copy the "JMyron Examples" folder into your Processing Examples folder.

IMPORTANT FOR WINDOWS USERS:
there is a folder called "Extra DLLs" - those are DLLs that JMyron depends on so make sure they're copied into your system's DLL search path - such as the Processing root directory, or even C:\windows\System32.


If Processing is already running, then restart it.

To import the library into your sketch, choose the menu "Sketch > Import Library > JMyron" and you will see "import JMyron.*;" appear at the top of the sketch. From here, please see the Examples folder for simple ways to see the camera. The most basic example is the "Myron_simpleCamera" sketch.
