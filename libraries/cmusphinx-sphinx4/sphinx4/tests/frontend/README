Sphinx 4 FrontEnd Tests
========================

Typing "gmake alltests" should run the frontend tests.


CMN and FeatureExtractor tests
------------------------------

test program: 	testCmnFeatExt.sh
uses:		CmnFeatureExtractorTest.java
inputs:		cepstra.s3 (generated by Sphinx 3)
		features.s3 (generated by Sphinx 3)
outputs:	features.out

Synopsis: Tests the CepstralMeanNormalizer.java and the
	FeatureExtractor.java using CmnFeatureExtractorTest.java. It reads
	in the cepstral file, cepstra.s3, generates CepstrumFrames, and
	calls the two process() methods on it. It outputs the
	generated FeatureFrames to feature.out, and does a diff to the
	feature output (features.s3) from Sphinx 3. It should output "0"
	if the test passes.
