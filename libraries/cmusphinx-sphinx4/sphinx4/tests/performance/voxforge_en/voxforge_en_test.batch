wav/ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-217.wav THIS IS THE OLD POINT 
wav/ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-227.wav THIS IS THE INITIAL CONDITION 
wav/ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-007.wav THEY HAVE TO CALCULATE THOSE SLOPES

wav/ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-027.wav THIS IS A SIMPLE IMPROVEMENT 
wav/ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-037.wav IT IS CALLED THE DIFFUSION EQUATION 
wav/ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-047.wav THAT IS THE EQUATION THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT 
wav/ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-057.wav HE INTRODUCED SEVERAL NOTATIONAL CONVENTIONS
