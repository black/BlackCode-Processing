This directory contains a example Clojure script.  This example reimplements the Transciber application.

Clojure is a popular choice for Java based scripting, and is a good choice for rapid development with Sphinx4.

To try this script, install Clojure from here

    http://clojure.org/

Then cd to src/scripts/clojure and type the following to the shell

    java -cp clojure \
    home>clojure.jar:../../../lib/sphinx4.jar:../../../lib/jsapi.jar \
    clojure.main ClojureTranscriber.clj
