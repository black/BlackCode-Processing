This directory contains a example Python script.  This example reimplements the Transciber application. 

Python is a popular choice for Java based scripting, and is a good choice for rapid development with Sphinx4.

To try this script, install Jython from here

    http://www.jython.org/

Then cd to src/scripts/python and type the following to the shell

    java -jar <Jython Home>/jython.jar PythonTrancriber.py
