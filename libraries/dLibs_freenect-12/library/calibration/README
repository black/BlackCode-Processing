Instructions: thomas diewald:
1) start: rgbd-viewer.exe
    1.2) Menue -> Capture  -> Dual RGB/IR mode
    1.3) set output directory: Options -> output dir "output_dir"
    1.3) place chessboard square visible to both cameras 
    1.4) save frame: Menue -> File -> Grab one Frame (Ctrl + G);
    1.5) repeat (1.3 - 1.4) 10 to 30 times
    
2) start: calibrate_kinect_ir.exe
    2.1) windows console: 
    calibrate_kinect_ir output_dir --pattern-size 0.025

 - Calibrating your Kinect - 
(explanation from http://nicolas.burrus.name/index.php/Research/KinectRgbDemoV4)

A sample calibration file is provided in data/kinect_calibration.yml. 
However, you should be able to get a more accurate mapping by estimating new 
parameters for each Kinect. Below is the procedure I follow.

1.  Build a calibration pattern as shown in KinectCalibration. 
    You can use the Chessboard_A4.pdf or Chessboard_A3.pdf file in 
    the data/ directory for this. I recommend printing the chessboard on a 
    sheet of paper and glue it on a peace of carton. 
    It is not necessary anymore to cut the carton around the paper.

2.  Grab some images of your chessboard using the 
    viewer (File / Grab frame or Ctrl-G). 
    WARNING: you need to grab images in Dual IR/RGB more (enable it in the 
    Capture menu). 
    By default it will save them into directories grab1/view????. 
    These directories contain the raw files, 
    raw/color.png, raw/depth.yml, raw/intensity.png 
    that corresponds to the color image, the depth image (in meters), and the 
    IR image normalized to grayscale. 
    You will also get an additional raw/depth.png which is the depth image 
    normalized to grayscale.

    
    To get an optimal calibration, grabbed images should ensure the following:

    * Cover as most image area as possible. Especially check for coverage of 
        the image corners.
        
    * Try to get the chessboard as close as possible to the camera to get 
        better precision.
        
    * For depth calibration, you will need some images with IR and depth. 
        But for stereo calibration, the depth information is not required, so 
        feel free to cover the IR projector and get very close to the camera to 
        better estimate IR intrinsics and stereo parameters. 
        The calibration algorithm will automatically determine which grabbed 
        images can be used for depth calibration.
        
    * Move the chessboard with various angles.
    
    * I usually grab a set of 30 images to average the errors.
    
    * Typical reprojection error is < 1 pixel. If you get significantly higher 
        values, it means the calibration failed. 

        
        
3. Run the calibration program:

build/bin/calibrate_kinect_ir --pattern-size 0.025 grab1

The pattern size correspond to the size in meters of one chessboard square. 
It should be 0.025 (25mm) for the A4 model.

This will generate the kinect_calibration.yml file storing the parameters for 
the viewer, and two files calibration_rgb.yaml and calibration_depth.yaml 
for ROS compatibility.
