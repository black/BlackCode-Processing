/**
 * Sequencer demo showing the following:
 * - typical use case for the MultiTimbralManager for playing multiple
 *   samples without truncating the playback of the ones already playing
 * - implementation of a simple, but with high precision timing sequencer
 *   running in its own thread and able to smoothly interpolate tempo changes
 * - rule-based, semi-randomized musical pattern creation from single note samples
 * - usage of wave generators to automate pattern volume (fading in/out)
 * - implements a chromatic scale to transpose all notes on demand
 * - 3D positioning of samples (MONO ONLY & NEEDS 3D capable soundcard, else only stereo pan)
 *
 * Key controls:
 * 1,2,3 : mute/unmute audio patterns
 * a - y : change global pitch (-/+1 octave up, m = normal pitch)
 * [ , ] : adjust pitch bending amount
 *
 * Click & drag mouse left/right to adjust tempo
