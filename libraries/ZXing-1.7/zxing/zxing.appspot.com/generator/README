To develop with Eclipse.

Before importing the project, you need to define some variables.
- In Eclipse Preferences, go to General->Workspace->Linked Resources.
- Click New and add the 2 following variables:
  - GWT_HOME that point to the directory containing gwt-user.jar
  - GWT_JAR that point to the gwt-dev-XXX.jar file directly. (XXX will be linux, mac, etc)
- then you can import the project by File->Import...->Existing project into workspace.
