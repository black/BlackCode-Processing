# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the library's function. This will be
# shown from inside the PDE when the library is being installed. Avoid repeating
# the name of your library here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant like
# mentioning that its a library. This should start with a capitalized letter, and
# end with a period.
sentence = this library provides simple tools needed in computer-vision.

# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the
# second sentence here. If your library only works on certain operating systems,
# mention it here.
paragraph =  blob-detection, connected component labeling, contour, convex hull,...

# Links in the 'sentence' and 'paragraph' attributes can be inserted using the
# same syntax as for authors. That is, [here is a link to Processing](http://processing.org/)


# A version number that increments once with each release. This
# is used to compare different versions of the same library, and
# check if an update is available. You should think of it as a
# counter, counting the total number of releases you've had.

# The version as the user will see it. If blank, the version attribute will be used here
