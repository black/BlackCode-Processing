/**
 * The version and build number of this implementation.
 * Version numbers for a release are of the form: w.x.y[-a]-z, where:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     w - the major version number of the release.  This number should
 *         start at 1.  Typically, a bump in the major version number
 *         signifies that the release breaks backwards compatibility
 *         with some older release.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     x - minor version number.  This number starts at 0.  A bump in
 *         the minor version number signifies a release that has significant
 *         new functionality.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     y - minor-minor version number number.  This number starts at 0.  A
 *         bump in the minor-minor version number signifies that new bug
 *         fixes have been  added to the build.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *    a - an optional build designator followed by a digit.  Valid build
 *        designators are:
 *    <ul>
 *      <li>alpha</li>
 *      <li>beta</li>
 *    </ul>
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *    z - build number.  This is used to specify the build number of the
 *        release.  This is usually only important to people that use
 *        the daily build of a project.  The format is the lower-case
 *        letter 'b' followed by a two digit number.
 *  </li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 * For example, the following are all valid version strings:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>1.1.2-b02</li>
 *   <li>1.3.5-alpha1-b19</li>
 *   <li>4.7.1-beta3-b20</li>
 * </ul>
